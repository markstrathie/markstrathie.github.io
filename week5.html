		<h1>Week 5 - Writing characteristics and adapting text</h1>
		
		<section id="il-task1">
		<h2>IL Task 1 - Review professional writing characteristics</h2>
		<p>I read over the following:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <td>1. ACCURACY</td>
			  <td>Inaccuracies show a carelessness that few professionals or organisations can afford in a competitive, global marketplace. Attention to accuracy is therefore paramount to web writers.
			  </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2. ACTIVE VOICE</td>
				<td>Avoid using passive voice construction when you can, unless you need to obscure the person committing an action; e.g.:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Passive Voice:</b> The website was written by me.</li>
						<li><b>Active Voice:</b> I wrote the website.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3. LIMIT BIASES</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Use they, instead of he/she to avoid gender bias.</li>
					<li>Beware of stereotypes to avoid biases, e.g.:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Age bias:</b> When you’re over 60, climbing stairs is always painful.</li>
						<li><b>Racial bias:</b> The website is available only in English, thus unfortunately only accessible to UK nationals.</li>
						<li><b>Implicit bias:</b> Welcome to Pretty Pink, a website dedicated to girls’ favourite subject: languages and literature!</li>
					</ul>
				</ul></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4. CLARITY</td>
				<td>Use words that your audience will recognise, and use them correctly.<br>
					Be careful of jargon and technical terminology, and provide definitions if necessary.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5. CONCISENESS</td>
				<td>
					Avoid wordiness – web readers’ impatience is documented and scientifically proven!</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>6. CONVERSATIONAL AND SMOOTHLY FLOWING PROSE</td>
				  <td><ul>
					<li>Use simple, plain language in sentences that are not complex or convoluted. </li>
					<li>Use contractions when appropriate (e.g. I’ll instead of I will). </li>
					<li>Against school learning, starting with conjunctions (e.g. and, but) gives text the right conversational tone.</li>
					</ul></td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>7. CORRECTNESS</td>
				  <td>Poor grammar, and words used incorrectly, make both the writer and the organisation appear ignorant and sloppy.
						<br>
					<b>Common mistakes:</b><br>
					<ul>
						<li>It’s = It is >> It’s late = It is late.
							Its = possessive pronoun, something belonging to “it” >> <br>
							The dog is chasing its tail (i.e. the tail belonging to the dog)</li>
						<li>Effect = noun >> Paracetamol has a positive effect on headaches.<br>
							Affect = verb >> Paracetamol can affect people’s stomach.</li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>8. PARALLELISM</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Parallelism is a writing technique that appeals to our natural desire for symmetry. Parallelism matches nouns with nouns, verbs with verbs, and phrases with phrases: “For faster action, less pain, and more for your money, use XX.”</li>
					<li>Readers expect parallelism, especially in sets of two or three items. Using parallel phrasing sets up an expectation, and when used correctly, delivers a punch.</li>
				</ul></td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>9. POSITIVE VOICE</td>
				  <td>
					Be mindful of downbeat words or words that have a negative connotation. If necessary, rephrase in a positive way. E.g.:
				<ul>
					<li>No entries to the competition are allowed after the 1st November.
						(emphasises restrictions and a missed opportunity)</li>
					<li>Entries to the competition are allowed until the 31st October.
						(emphasises permission and opportunity)</li>
				</ul></td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>10. STRONG NOUNS AND VERBS</td>
				  <td><ul>
						<li>Use nouns and verbs to do the heavy work, and save adverbs and adjectives for necessary emphasis. E.g.:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Our website offers you high-quality, accurate news content. </li>
							<p>Instead of… </p>
							<li>Our amazing website is your only and most trustworthy source for the highest quality, and of exquisite accuracy, news content.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Check for overuse of the verb to be (is, are, were, was, has been etc.) and see if you can use a stronger, more specific verb instead. E.g.:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The competition starts on the 1st October. </li>
							<p>Instead of… </p>
							<li>The start date for the competition is the 1st October.</li>
						</ul>
				  </ul></td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>11. SENTENCE VARIETY</td>
				  <td><ul>
					<li>Avoid writing sentences that begin with the same word or phrase.
						(There is, There are, As mentioned before are common culprits!) </li>
					<li>Vary sentence length combining short, medium and longer sentences.</li>
					</ul></td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>12. SIMPLE WORDS</td>
				  <td>
					Prefer more recognisable words over showy words. E.g.:
					<ul>
						<li>Email instead of electronic message</li>
						<li>The increase in unemployment was the result of expenditure cuts.
							instead of…
							The increase in unemployment was the corollary of expenditure cuts. </li>
					</ul></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>13. SHORTER PARAGRAPHS</td>
					<td>
						Long paragraphs are maybe good for essays, but can scare web readers! Opt for no more than 6-8 lines for web paragraphs – remember the research on visitors’ attention span.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>14. TONE AND VOICE</td>
					<td>
						Adjust your writing attitude to the task at hand. Tone and voice are tied to the intended audience and the purpose of a website. E.g.:
					<ul>
						<li>Some web content will require a formal voice, which is controlled and objective – e.g. information on taxation rules in gov.uk web page.</li>
						<li>Other content may call for an informal tone in which you can be more personal and casual, e.g. a personal blog of your travels.</li>
					</ul></td>
				</tr>

		<h2>IL Task 2 - Evaluate resources</h2>
		<p>I chose the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/">Apple UK</a> website to evaluate against the 14 professional writing characteristics.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <td>1. ACCURACY</td>
			  <td>This is the manufacturer's website so it's expected to be accurate and informative about its own products. It succeeds in this regard by providing a page of technical specifications for people to check that want more detail or to check the facts - <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-15-pro/specs/">apple.com/uk/iphone-15-pro/specs</a>

			  </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2. ACTIVE VOICE</td>
				<td>Active voice is used successfully to build a connection with the customer. Words like 'we' and 'our' are used to refer the the brand. The reader is addressed as 'you', as if Apple are having a conversations with the customer.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3. LIMIT BIASES</td>
				<td><ul>
						Apple are sucessful in creating text that feels personal with sentences like 'taking a photo at your daughter's football match,' without relying on any sterotypes or biases. They also have the option to select your region, making it available to many non-English speakers:
						<p></p>
						<img src="img/apple-countries.png" alt="Apple's list of countries" height="400">
				</ul></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4. CLARITY</td>
				<td><i>"iPhone 15 Pro is the first iPhone to feature an aerospace‑grade titanium design, using the same alloy that spacecraft use for missions to Mars."</i> As seen here, Apple provide clarity on the material of titanium. Instead of lauching into jargon about it's physical properties, they compare it to the spacecraft used in NASA's missions to Mars, something that the majority of people will be familiar with.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5. CONCISENESS</td>
				<td>
					As shown below, Apple breaks up its text into concise chunks that are easy to digest by using many small paragraphs and lists. This makes it easier for the reader to pick out information they deem relevant in the phone for them.
					<p></p>
					<img src="img/apple-conciseness.png" alt="Apple's conciseness" height="400">
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>6. CONVERSATIONAL AND SMOOTHLY FLOWING PROSE</td>
				  <td><ul>
					Apple successfully using contractions and sentences beginning with 'And' to acheive an informal and personal tone. All their sentences are arranged in small paragraphs making the text flow smoothly.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>7. CORRECTNESS</td>
				  <td>No evident spelling or grammer mistakes.
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>8. PARALLELISM</td>
				<td>"Enter A17 Pro.
					Game‑changing chip. Groundbreaking performance." Parallelism is used to deliver a punch on the key features.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>9. POSITIVE VOICE</td>
				  <td>
					When discussing battery life, the performance is positively emphasised - 'Up to 29 hrs.' They do not say 'Only 29 hrs' or 'The battery will run out after 29hrs.' This technique is used throughout.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>10. STRONG NOUNS AND VERBS</td>
				  <td>Apple uses simple but bold sentences like "A camera that captures your wildest imagination."</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>11. SENTENCE VARIETY</td>
				  <td>They begin paragraphs and sentences with a variety of phrases, questions and words.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				  <td>12. SIMPLE WORDS</td>
				  <td>
					Apple prioritises simple words over showy words. Any technical or more complicated terms are always explained with a simile or additional information.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>13. SHORTER PARAGRAPHS</td>
					<td>
						Text is used sparingly in combination with videos and large pictures to keep the readers' attentions.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>14. TONE AND VOICE</td>
					<td>
					Tone is kept professional but friendly.</li>
					</ul></td>

		<h2>IL Task 3 - The Awe writing process</h2>

		<img src="img/awe1.png" alt="AWE writing process" style="background-color:white;" height="400">

		<p>In reference to the Assess step of the AWE process above, I feel I am very ready to write about my website.
		
			<br><p></p>For the first step, I have defined by audience as my peer group. This will be majority male, 20–30-year-olds who are coming to the end of university and thinking about the beginning of a career in the tech industry. They will see me as a peer which I plan to use to my advantage as it will allow be to frame things from their point of view. My knowledge and education level will be on-par with theirs, but the website will be in the style of ‘let’s learn this together.’ My audience will be proficient in English and my website will only be provided in English. Online translators are readily available. My audience will have preferences in the tech industry and so I plan to be able to make some assumption on base-knowledge of my audience. I want my audience action to be to leave the website considering a career in data analysis or related to data science. The language of the technology industry is overwhelmingly English on a global scale, so I do not plan to have to make any special adjustments.
<br><p></p>Next, I have defined the purpose of my project to inform students and young professionals of the fundamentals of data science and persuade them to learn basic skills and use simple AI tools.
<br><p></p>Conducting research has so far involved me reading articles and a few academic journals on AI and data science. Most of my work has been on creating my portfolio and learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, I plan to incorporate my personal experiences working as a data analyst at a market research company and my work on 2 data analysis projects in am working on right now. I have also found coding websites that offer tutorials that I will utilise.
<br><p></p>Finally, organising, categorising and outlining has involved keeping a resources folder of all the articles I find relevant. I have outlined a simple narrative in my first reflection document.
<br>The collection of all this work makes me confident that I can begin a draft outline of my topic, with small paragraphs as a starting point.

			<h2>Lab Task 1 - Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content</h2>
			<p><b>Part One</b></p>
			<p>I analysed the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-15-pro/">Apple iPhone 15 Pro page</a> using <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a>:</p>
			<img src="img/voyant-tools.png" alt="Voyant Tools analysis" height="400">
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Part Two</b></p>
			<p>I explored the results from Voyant Tools to analyse my resource. Cirrus tab: High-frequency words could be used to infer what Apple thinks is the most important features of the new phone. 'Titanium' is used 24 times. This material can be seen is a big selling point due to its strength-to-weight ratio. 'Camera' and 'Zoom' are used 22 and 14 times - high-quality cameras have always been a strong selling point for iPhones.</p>
			<p></p>	
			<img src="img/voyant-cirrus.png" alt="my code editor" height="400">
			<p></p>
			<p>Trends tab: this shows the flow of the text. 'Titanium' is mentioned heavily at the beginning of the text, showing that Apple open with that as the main feature of the phone. 'Camera' is mentioned a lot in the middle of the web page, showing it is 2nd or 3rd priority.</p>
			<p></p>
			<img src="img/voyant-trends.png" alt="my code editor" height="400">
			<p></p>
			<p>Bubblelines tab: 'Apple' is mentioned more (61 times in total) towards the end of the page as they link the iPhone into their brand identity and show their other products and payment plans.</p>
			<p></p>
			<img src="img/voyant-bubblelines.png" alt="my code editor" height="400">
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Part Three</b></p>
			<p>Comparing my analysis in the IL task above to the analysis in this task, the results are very different. The 14 points from the IL task analyse the writing style in a more high-level way, looking at overall tone and and structure. Whereas Voyant Tools analyses the content of the writing - the text - in a more in-depth way. Both are useful in combination.</p>

			<h2>Lab Task 2 - Create Samples of text</h2>
			<p>My target audience are my peer group of students or young professionals seeking a career in the tech industry. Predominantly male, 20-30 years old.</p>
			<p>Key points from my narrative are the opening scene - introducing data science. And introducing AI towards the end of the narrative. I will write a sample paragraph for each below:</p>
			<p></p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>We are surrounded by more data than we can comprehend. The average internet user creates over <b>1.7 megabytes per second</b>. This amounts to more than <b>40 trillion gigabytes per year</b>.<br><p></p>
			All this data is extremely valuable to organisations who can use it to make <b>data-driven decisions</b> – using the data to provide insights into how successful their services are, how to improve upon them, and <b>drive up their profits</b>. <br><p></p>
			However, specialists are essential for this task. Because internet users simply go about their daily business on a variety of devices from mobiles to laptops. They interact with different websites and platforms. The result is that <b>80-90% of data is unstructured</b> and not valuable in this form. Before insights can be provided, data needs to be collected, stored, cleaned and analysed. This is where the role of the <b>Data Scientist</b> comes in. <br><p></p>
			There’s such an abundance of data, and a shortage of skilled data scientists, that the early stages of collecting to analysing data provide <b>substantial value</b> compared to previous decision-making methods. Once much of the insights provided by this process have been exhausted, the new methods of deep learning and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> can be utilised.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>Now that we have explored the fundamentals of data science, we should turn our attention to what AI tools are currently used in the industry. Many aspects of data science are increasingly being automated using automated machine learning to improve productivity. This is called AutoML. And once analytic models have been developed, their accuracy is monitored by machine learning operations tools called MLOps. <br><p></p>
				There are also large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. These tools have the ability to create code, saving us time from writing out boilerplate and other simple code. ChatGPT can be used as a ‘data assistant,’ providing us with advice on how to define data structures, arrange charts and suggest information for reports. <br><p></p>
				An important issue we need to be aware of when using these tools is AI ethics. Chat-GPT can help provide us with guidelines on how to make sure our use of AI doesn’t violate privacy terms, reinforce biases and is used sustainably. 
				</p></li></ul>

				<tr>
				  <td>1. ACCURACY</td>
				  <td>
						I know my text is reasonably accurate as I used various sources to back up my claims. However, I did not check how credible these were, as some were just online articles. To improve upon this in my final version, I will add references and check credibility of my sources.
				  </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2. ACTIVE VOICE</td>
					<td>I used active voice a lot with words 'we,' 'us,' and 'our.' I hope this will make the reader engage more with the text.

					  <td>
						While AI is providing competition for data scientists, and is causing some to worry about their career security, I focus the text on what data scientists can still do that AI can't. And how to incorporate these AI tools to make your job even more efficient and therefore valuable in the industry.</td>
