		<h3>ASKING QUESTIONS</h3>
		<p><i>“If I was given 1 hour to save the planet I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and 1 minute resolving it.”</i><br>
			- Albert Einstein
			<br>
			<br>
			The start of any data analysis project is to ask the right questions. Data is now the world's most valuable resource and contains an infinite number of insights that help to make the right data-driven decisions. However, these insights change depending on the questions you are trying to answer. Spending countless hours on a project can result in wasted resources when the results are not found to be reliable or applicable, depending on the circumstances.
			<br>
			<br>
			In order to ask the right questions, or define the best business objective, it is crucial to be aware of any bias and gut instincts, as these can influence your analysis process. It is also important to remember that correlation does not equal causation - a relationship between variables can be due to a variety of factors and is not always obvious. In order to help the planning process, there are 3 frameworks that help you to think in a more analytical way. These examples can be replaced by your own project.

			<h3>AI ASSISTANCE</h3>
			<p>For any part of the data analysis process, you can use AI assistance from ChatGPT. This website will focus on ChatGPT 3.5 which is free to use. Firstly, you need to make an account by visiting <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT's start page</a>. You can now use the chatbot in your web browser to help with every aspect of your data analysis. For the next 3 frameworks, if you are struggling or want reassurance or new ideas, you can prompt ChatGPT for questions that help define your project's objective. We will show example prompts from ChatGPT which can be altered depending on your own project.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>SMART Questions</h3>
				<p>These help with problem solving and effective questioning. In our example of an analysis project related to music trends, these would be the following types of questions:
				<ul>
					<li>Specific: Does the question focus on a particular metric for success?</li>
					<li>Measurable: Does the question include a song rating system?</li>
					<li>Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new musical themes?</li>
					<li>Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential album success?</li>
					<li>Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular music from the last three years?</li>
				</ul>
				Specific example questions for our Kanye West lyrics and album analysis objectives will be the following:
				<ul>
					<li>On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how relevant are song lyrics to an album's success?</li>
					<li>What are the top 5 lyrical themes that influence a successful album?</li>
					<li>What song elements would make listeners more likely to stream the song?</li>
					<li>Have certain themes become more or less popular in the last three years?</li>
					<li><a href='https://www.complex.com/music/a/markelibert/kanye-west-streaming-pirating-sells-vultures-2-website'>How much would a listener pay for a full album instead of consuming via streaming services?</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h3>The 5 Whys</h3>
				<p>The second framework is to ask "Why?" 5 times to get to the root cause of an issue. The following is our thought process for this project.
					<br>
					<br>
					Why analyse musical trends?
					<ul><i>Because millions of people listen to music. It has a powerful amount of influence and cultural impact, it is a multi-million-pound industry, not to mention the simple enjoyment of it as an art form.</i></ul>
					Why analyse Kanye West?
					<ul><i>Because he is one of the top musical artists in the world, currently the <a href='https://open.spotify.com/artist/5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x'>6th top artist in the world on Spotify</a>. His reach and influence is tremendous.</i></ul>
					Why is Kanye West one of the top musicians?
					<ul><i>Because he has <a href='https://chartmasters.org/kanye-west-albums-and-songs-sales/'>some of the highest amount of song streams and album sales in the world</a>.</i></ul>
					Why is his music so popular?
					<ul><i>Because he is a controversial figure, <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest'>often appearing in the media</a>. He is a talented musician. Because of the content of his music.</i></ul>
					<br>
					<b>Why is his content popular and controversial?</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					This is now the root question that can help with our trend analysis.

Prompt:

Why analyse musical trends?


Answer:

Analyzing musical trends offers several benefits and insights for researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts alike. Here are some reasons why analyzing musical trends is valuable:

- Understanding Cultural Shifts: Music is deeply intertwined with culture, and analyzing musical trends allows us to understand societal changes, attitudes, and values over time. By studying which genres, styles, and artists are popular at different periods, we can gain insights into cultural shifts and movements.
- Identifying Emerging Genres and Artists: Analyzing musical trends helps identify emerging genres, subgenres, and artists who are gaining traction within the industry and among audiences. This information is invaluable for record labels, promoters, and music platforms seeking to stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on emerging trends.
- Consumer Preferences and Behavior: Studying musical trends provides insights into consumer preferences and behavior, including what types of music are resonating with different demographics, geographic regions, and cultural communities. This information is crucial for marketing, audience targeting, and content curation strategies.
- Predictive Analysis: Analyzing musical trends allows for predictive analysis, where patterns and correlations in past data can be used to forecast future trends and anticipate market demand. This is particularly valuable for stakeholders in the music industry, including record labels, streaming platforms, and concert promoters, who can use predictive analysis to make informed decisions about signings, releases, and tour planning.
- Academic Research: Musical trends are of interest to scholars in various fields, including musicology, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies. Analyzing musical trends provides rich material for academic research on topics such as cultural globalization, identity formation, and the social functions of music.

Overall, analyzing musical trends offers valuable insights into the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of music, illuminating the connections between music, culture, and society.</code>

				<h3>Data Analysis is Iterative</h3>
				<p>Often with your data analysis projects you will need to follow a non-linear path. Do not be afraid to return to previous stages, including the planning stage, to ask more questions. The nature of your project can evolve as you explore the data. Visit the next stage of the process, <a href="prepare.html">preparing your data</a>.</p>
