		<h1>Week 1 - Website topic and HTML code</h1>
		
		<section id="il-task1">
		<h2>IL Task 1 - Choosing my topic</h2>
		<p>To begin choosing my topic I reviewed the course description located <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/digitalmedia/">here</a>, and I then made a list of Digital Media topics I was interested in personally, based on my experience of the first 2 years of my degree:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
			<li>Machine learning</li>
			<li>Data analytics and visualisation</li>
			<li>Multimedia analysis and design</li>
			<li>3D modelling</li>
			<li>Web design</li>
			<li>Cloud networking</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I then refined my list by thinking about related careers, as this will give my website some real-world relevance, and I put some thought into these. I tried to find out what I was passionate about, what careers relate to this, and how my topic can offer value to an audience. I also considered the emergence of AI and how this will influence most apsects of digital media and the tech industry. The list of careers I came up with was:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Data Analyst</li>
			<li>Business Analyst</li>
			<li>Cloud Engineer</li>
			<li>Machine Learning Engineer</li>
			<li>Project Manager (in tech)</li>
			<li>Market Researcher</li>
		</ul>
		<p>At this point I considered that the topic of AI and the subtopic of machine learning was too prevalent in the tech industry to ignore, so this was one of my top options. However, I am most passionate about data analysis. Cloud engineering and machine learning felt to me to have too steep a learning curve to discuss in my website. However, much of the base skills, such as python programming, have a lot of cross-over relevance. In data analysis I considered I could talk about libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib. I thought the target audience could be someone in the same stage of their education and career as me - coming to the end of their degree and trying to start a career in the tech industry. At the end of this task my top 3 topics were as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Data analysis</li>
			<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
			<li>Cloud networking</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>IL Task 2 - Explore the scope of the topic and narrow down the focus</h2>
		<p>Potential questions that I want my website to answer:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Why should you consider a career in data analysis?</li>
			<li>Why should you consider a career in cloud engineering?</li>
			<li>How will AI affect you as an analyst/engineer?</li>
			<li>Why you should incorporate AI into your data analysis</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I started searching for articles using <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/">Google search</a> and the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/">UofG library search</a>. I started keeping a log sheet and Metadata and Justification Table excel spreadsheet to record how I searched for information. Links to download these can be found below under the Task 3 heading. I decided on my topic of <b>Why you need to incorporate AI into your data analysis</b>. This YouTube video helped me decide on my topic:</p>

		<h2>IL Task 3 - Keeping track of my resources</h2>
		<p>I uploaded my log sheet, Metadata and Justification Table excel spreadsheet, and resources folder:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="downloads/log.docx" download>Log sheet</a></li>
			<li><a href="downloads/mada-metadata_justification_table.xlsx" download>Spreadsheet</a></li>
			<li><a href="downloads/resources.zip" download>Resources folder</a></li>

			<h2>Lab Task 1 - Setting up my file structure</h2>
			<p>From <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=30361&seqNum=4">Organizing a Web Site's Files</a>, from <a href="https://www.informit.com/store/absolute-beginners-guide-to-creating-web-pages-9780789728951?w_ptgrevartcl=What+You+Need+to+Get+Started+Creating+Web+Pages_30361">the Absolute Beginner's Guide to Creating Web Pages, 2nd Edition (Stauffer, 2002)</a>, it became clear to me that a hybrid file structure is the most practical to use. Additionally, I used this file structure in my Web Application Development class last year, so it is the most familiar to me - therefore the one I chose for this project. I am already familiar with file naming conventions, such as using lowercase letters, hyphens/underscores, and avoiding spaces. I then downloaded the MAD (A) Template file system and HTML documents, adjusting them as necessary to fit my hybrid file structure and page names.</p>

			<h2>Lab Task 2 - Review of HTML</h2>
			<p>I am already very confident in my HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding skills, as I took Computer Science in Years 1 and 2. I will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to write the code for my website, and <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> for version control and uploading to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. To refresh my memory on some frequently used tags I had a look at the following page provided in the MADA HTML template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="review_of_useful_tags.html">Review of useful tags</a></li>
			</ul>

				<h2>Lab Task 3 - Create your own HTML files</h2>
				<p>I started the coding process now by coding this first week 1 web page. It includes my thought process in deciding my topic, links to download all my resources, and various tags for navigation and displaying images.</p>
