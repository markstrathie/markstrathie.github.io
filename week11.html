		<h2>IL Task 1 - Review of progress</h2>
		<p>So far I have comepleted most of my portfolio website. My next main tasks in to write my 2000 word personal reflection which I will include on this page when compelte. Regarding my website, the first thing I want to do is improve accessibility by styling hyperlinks to improve readability. Next I would like to improve the CSS layouts of my pages. I could also improve the navigation of my website by labelling the weeks by each topic. I would also like to include more information on the Data Analysis and AI topic on my homepage. You can check my <a href="https://github.com/markstrathie/markstrathie.github.io/commits/main">previous versions on github</a> to see how these progress.</p>
