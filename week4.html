		<h2>IL Task 1 - Review of CSS</h2>
		<p>I really like the tutorials at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">W3Schools</a> so I read through them to learn CSS fundamentals.</p>
		<p>I then completed the exercies at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_exercises.asp">CSS Exercises</a> to test my knowledge and prepare to style my page in the lab task.</p>

		<section id="lab-task1">
			<h2>Lab Task 1 - Create my external CSS sheet</h2>
			<p>I already created a CSS sheet last week called mystyle.css and linked it to my html pages. However, I downloaded the <a href="css/csstemplate.css" download>template</a> provided on the Moodle to give me further ideas.</p>
		</section>
			
			<section id="lab-task2">
			<h2>Lab Task 2 - Style my page</h2>
			<p>When experimenting with CSS I already specified background colours, text colours and font families. You can see this on my pages for weeks 1-3. In the pages going forward you will see the progression of my design and CSS skills. I will leave the first weeks as my old design to highlight the differences.</p>
