		<section id="il-task1">
		<h2>IL Task 1 - Review of CSS</h2>
		<p>I really like the tutorials at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">W3Schools</a> so I read through them to learn CSS fundamentals.</p>
		<p>I then completed the exercies at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_exercises.asp">CSS Exercises</a> to test my knowledge and prepare to style my page in the lab task.</p>

		<section id="lab-task1">
			<h2>Lab Task 1 - Create my external CSS sheet</h2>
			<p>I already created a CSS sheet last week called mystyle.css and linked it to my html pages. However, I downloaded the <a href="css/csstemplate.css" download>template</a> provided on the Moodle to give me further ideas.</p>

			<section id="lab-task2">
			<h2>Lab Task 2 - Style my page</h2>
			<p>When experimenting with CSS I already specified background colours, text colours and font families. You can see this on my pages for weeks 1-3. In the pages going forward you will see the progression of my design and CSS skills. I will leave the first weeks as my old design to highlight the differences.</p> 
			<p>I watched the following tutorials to learn how to use Flexbox, make a navigation bar, and use JavaScript to create a menu for mobiles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwWHL3RyQgk">Navbar CSS Tutorial: 3 Ways to Create a Navigation Bar with Flexbox</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBMp6yUXO0">Responsive navbar tutorial using HTML CSS & JS</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU">Learn flexbox the easy way</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I then updated the style of my index page to incorporate the new skills I learned. I paid attention to make my design responsive to different window sizes and device by using a media query in the css. I also made it more accessible by writing descriptions for any hidden content so that people using a screen reader can still navigate my portfolio website. I picked the text <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto">Roboto Mono</a> as this looks like the text in Git Bash, echoing characteristics of coding. I used underlines in the navigation links to achieve this effect as well. I then used the websites <a href="http://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> and <a href="http://pexels.com">Pexels</a> to find high-quality images for my index page. I added the sources to my metadata spreadsheet. You can see all these updates on my index page now.</p>
