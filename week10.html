		<h1>Week 10 - Evaluating and Improving Accessibility</h1>
		
		<section id="il-task1">
		<h2>IL Task 1 - Evaluate websites against accessibility standards</h2>
		<p>I used the<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> on one of my informative websites <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a></p>
		<img src="img/week10-tool1.png" alt="SpaceX evaluation" height="400">
		<p>As shown in the above screenshot, the website initally complies with the accessibility standards. However, there were 2 alerts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>No heading structure. Headings (h1-h6) provide important document structure, outlines, and navigation functionality to assistive technology users.</li>
			<li>A link to a PDF document is present. Unless authored with accessibility in mind, PDF documents often have accessibility issues. Additionally, PDF documents are typically viewed using a separate application or plug-in, and can thus cause confusion and navigation difficulties.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These are 2 important points I will consider in my website design. The next tool is <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=0000FF&bcolor=FFFFFF">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a></p>
		<img src="img/week10-tool2.png" alt="SpaceX contrast evaluation" height="400">
		<p>Black background with white text passes all the readability tests. This is the main theme of my website. The third test is the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/linkcontrastchecker/?fcolor=0000FF&bcolor=FFFFFF">Link Contrast Checker</a>.</p>
		<img src="img/week10-tool3.png" alt="SpaceX link contrast evaluation" height="400">
		<p>This tool passes hyperlinks contrast to the background but not to the body text, as they are both the same colour. However, on SpaceX the hyperlinks are formatted in bold. The tool does not take this into account. I may change the format of my hyperlinks but I will consider the accessibility before I do. The final test is the <a href="https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/">Readability Test Tool</a>.</p>
		<img src="img/week10-tool4.png" alt="SpaceX readability evaluation" height="400">
		<p>As shown in the screenshot, the evaluation concludes that the website article is suitable for 15-16 year olds. This seems like a good general level. I feel my website will have a slightly higher reading level as I plan to use more technical words to explain coding and data science concepts.</p>

		<h2>IL Task 2 - Record your evaluation and reflect on your own practice</h2>
		<p>As discussed above, the SpaceX website gets a lot right, but it could be improved upon. PDF files could instead be full html pages to improve accessibility. This would stop users having to have a separate application to access the pdfs and make sure that a screen reader could access the text. Headings (h1-h6) can be used to help structure the text which would improve readability for screen readers as well. Everything else on the website complies with accessibility guidance from my evaluation.</p>
		<p>After completing the above evaluation, I have realised a lot that my portfolio website has got right, but also some things wrong, in regards to accessibility. My pages use headings and various html formatting such as lists and tables. These methods help with legibility for screen readers. I also make use of span tag and aria labels to add text to my menu icon and navbar so screen readers can read it out to help with navigation. I beleive my writing style is suitable - not too technical but not at such a low level people will disengage. The colours I have picked are also suitable for contrast and readability. However, the default hyperlink colour does not contrast enough. I will plan to change this to white and bold as inspirated by the SpaceX website. Another thing I could improve on is the layout of my pages. They are quite text heavy and disjointed when the media changes between text and images. I may try to improve this later. I would also like to check all more hyperlinks to make sure they are labelled properly and not just 'click here.'</p>

			<h2>Lab Task 1 - Learn about closed captions and subtitles</h2>
			<p>I read the resource at <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/blog/add-captions-subtitles-video/">techsmith</a> to learn more. Subtitles are transcribed text from spoken dialogue. Captions are text to explain other sound effects such a music or noises.</p>

				<h2>Lab Task 3 - What about other forms of accessibility?</h2>
				<p>I am happy with the high quality version above. I am satisfied I have used enough effects and material to make the quick video engaging, without over producing it and distracting from the main message. While the file size is quite high 1080p at 82.3mb compared to the low quality version 480p at 2.68mb, I feel the quality is worth it. Many people have at least 1080p monitors or larger and lower quality will negatively affect users here. All the versions can be viewed above.</p>
